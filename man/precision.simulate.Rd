\details{
The classification anlaysis of simulation study consists of the following main steps:

First, \code{precision.simulate} requires the training and test sets for both estimated biological effects and estimated handling effects.
The effects can be simulated as follows (using \code{estimate.biological.effect} and \code{estimate.handling.effect}).
The uniformly-handled dataset are used to approximate the biological effect for each sample,
and the difference between the two arrays (one from the uniformly-handled dataset and
the other from the nonuniformly-handled dataset, subtracting the former from the latter)
for the same sample are used to approximate the handling effect for each array in the nonuniformly-handled dataset.

The samples are randomly split into a training set and a test set, balanced by tumor type (in Qin et al., training-to-test ratio is 2:1).
The arrays were then non-randomly split to a training set and a test set (in Qin et al., training set n = 128 -- the first 64 and last 64 arrays
in the order of array processing; test set n = 64 -- the middle 64 arrays).
This setup allows different pairings of arrays and samples by various different training-and-test-set splits.
Furthermore, biological signal strength and confounding level of the handling effects can be modified
(using \code{reduce.signal} and \code{amplify.handling.effect}).

Second, for the training set, data are simulated through "virtual re-hybridization" (using \code{rehybridize})
by first assigning arrays to sample groups using a confounding design or a balanced design, and
then summing the biological effect for a sample and the handling effect for its assigned array.
Rehybridization allows us to examine the use of various array-assignment schemes, specified in \code{design.list}.

Third, the analysis for each simulated dataset follows the same steps as described
for the analysis of the uniformly-handled data (also see documentation on \code{uni.handled.siumate}):

(1) data preprocessing (normalization methods are specified in \code{norm.list} and
batch effects can be adjusted specified with \code{icombat}, \code{isva} and \code{iruv})

(2) classifier training (classification methods are specified in \code{class.list})

(3) classification error estimation using both cross-validation and external validation

The external validation is based on the test data from the uniformly-handled dataset
and served as the gold standard for the misclassification error estimation.

For a given split of samples to training set versus test set,
\code{N} datasets will be simulated and analyzed for each array-assignment scheme.
For user-defined normalization method or classification method, please refer to the vignette.
